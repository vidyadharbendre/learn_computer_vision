# Effects of Aliasing and Downsampling

## Aliasing and Downsampling

Aliasing can significantly affect the quality of images captured by sensors. When downsampling a signal using a poor quality filter, such as a box (square) filter, the negative impacts of aliasing become evident.

### Example of Downsampling

Consider a high-frequency chirp image. Sampling it with a 25% fill-factor area sensor, a 100% fill-factor sensor, and a high-quality 9-tap filter demonstrates varying levels of aliasing and image quality.
