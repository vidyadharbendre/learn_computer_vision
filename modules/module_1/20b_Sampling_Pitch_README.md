# Sampling Pitch

Sampling pitch refers to the distance between individual pixels on an image sensor and affects image resolution and quality.

## What is Sampling Pitch?

- **Definition**: The physical distance between the centers of adjacent pixels on a sensor.
- **Impact on Resolution**: Smaller sampling pitches lead to higher resolutions, capturing more detail.

## Key Considerations

1. **Pixel Size vs. Pixel Density**: A balance between pixel size and density is crucial for optimal image quality.
2. **Noise Levels**: Smaller pixels may produce more noise, especially in low-light conditions.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the relationship between sampling pitch and image resolution.
- Recognize the trade-offs in sensor design.

## Next Steps

- Explore **Fill Factor** and its relevance to sensor efficiency.
