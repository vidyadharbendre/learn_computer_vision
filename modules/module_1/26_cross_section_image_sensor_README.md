# Cross-Section of an Image Sensor

Image sensors, like **CCD (Charge-Coupled Devices)** and **CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)** sensors, capture light and convert it into electrical signals for image processing. This document outlines the different layers and components involved in the cross-section of an image sensor.

## 1. Microlens Layer
- **Function**: Microlenses are small lenses placed over each pixel.
- **Purpose**: Focus incoming light onto the underlying photodiodes.
- **Benefit**: Enhances light sensitivity by collecting more light and reducing scattering.

## 2. Color Filter Array (CFA)
- **Function**: A color filter is placed over each pixel to capture color information.
- **Types**: Typically, a **Bayer filter** is used, consisting of red, green, and blue filters.
- **Purpose**: Allows the sensor to interpret color by filtering specific wavelengths of light to the appropriate photodiodes.

## 3. Photodiode (Photosensitive Layer)
- **Function**: Converts incoming light (photons) into electrical charge (electrons).
- **Material**: Usually made of **silicon**.
- **Key Role**: The number of electrons generated is proportional to the lightâ€™s intensity.
- **Interaction with Light**: Light with shorter wavelengths (e.g., blue light) is absorbed closer to the surface, while longer wavelengths (e.g., red light) penetrate deeper.

## 4. Silicon Substrate
- **Function**: The main body of the sensor, which supports the photodiodes and other electronic components.
- **Importance**: Houses the electrical charge generated by each photodiode.
- **Interaction with Light**: Determines the depth at which light is absorbed, playing a role in the sensor's sensitivity to different wavelengths.

## 5. Charge Collection and Transfer
- **Function (CCD)**: Charges generated by the photodiodes are transferred pixel-by-pixel to the output amplifier (bucket brigade system).
- **Function (CMOS)**: Charges are amplified and converted to voltage directly in each pixel.
- **Purpose**: Moves the electrical signal for conversion into a digital signal.

## 6. Readout Circuitry
- **Function**: Processes and amplifies the electrical signal from each pixel.
- **Purpose**: Converts the captured charge into a readable digital signal for post-processing.
- **Benefit**: Ensures that the output is accurate and proportional to the captured light.

## 7. Pixel Size vs. Light Wavelength
- **Relationship**: The wavelength of light and pixel size are closely related. The smaller the pixel, the more likely it is to miss light of longer wavelengths.
- **Limitation**: Reducing pixel size further can limit how much light is captured, especially for longer wavelengths like red light, leading to decreased image quality.
- **Why We Can't Go Smaller**: Reducing pixel size below a certain limit leads to less light being captured and poorer signal-to-noise ratio, affecting the quality of the image.

## Conclusion
The cross-section of an image sensor includes several layers that work together to convert light into an electrical signal, which is then processed into a digital image. Understanding the different components helps in grasping how image sensors balance factors like light sensitivity, pixel size, and image quality.
