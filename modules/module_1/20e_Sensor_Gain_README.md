# Sensor Gain

Sensor gain refers to the amplification of the signal produced by the image sensor and is crucial for achieving proper exposure.

## What is Sensor Gain?

- **Definition**: The amplification factor applied to the signal from the sensor to increase its brightness.
- **Measured in**: Decibels (dB) or as a linear gain factor.

## Importance of Sensor Gain

1. **Low-Light Performance**: Higher gain increases sensitivity to light, improving performance in low-light conditions.
2. **Noise Considerations**: Excessive gain can introduce noise, affecting image quality.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how sensor gain impacts exposure and image quality.
- Learn to adjust gain settings for different shooting conditions.

## Next Steps

- Explore **Resolution** and its effect on image quality.
