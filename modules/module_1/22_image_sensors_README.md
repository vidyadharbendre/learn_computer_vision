# Image Sensors: An Overview

Image sensors are crucial components in devices like cameras and scanners. These sensors capture light and convert it into electrical signals, creating digital images.

## Types of Image Sensors

- **CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) Sensors**  
  - High-speed and energy-efficient.  
  - Commonly used in smartphones and compact digital cameras.  

- **CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) Sensors**  
  - Known for producing high image quality.  
  - Used in professional cameras, medical imaging devices, and astronomy.  

## How Image Sensors Work

1. **Photons** (light particles) hit the sensor surface.  
2. The sensor converts incoming light into **electric charges**.  
3. Charges are converted into **digital signals**.  
4. The resulting digital data forms the final image.

## Conclusion

Image sensors have revolutionized the way we capture and process images. With both **CMOS** and **CCD** technologies playing a key role, they power everything from consumer electronics to specialized scientific instruments.
