## 1. What is Computer Vision?

**Computer Vision** is the field of study that enables computers to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. It seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can perform, such as object recognition, image classification, scene reconstruction, etc.

### Key Objectives of Computer Vision:
* **Image Recognition**: Identifying objects, places, people, and other subjects in an image.
* **Image Classification**: Categorizing images into predefined labels.
* **Object Detection**: Locating objects within an image.
* **Image Segmentation**: Dividing an image into multiple segments (regions).
* **Image Reconstruction**: Recreating 3D models from 2D images.

## 2. A Brief History of Computer Vision

The history of **Computer Vision** dates back to the 1960s when researchers began developing algorithms to analyze images. Over the decades, the field has evolved through various stages:

* **1960s**: The early work focused on simple shape recognition using line drawings.
* **1970s**: The development of edge detection techniques, such as the **Canny edge detector**.
* **1980s - 1990s**: Introduction of more sophisticated algorithms like the **Hough transform** for detecting geometric shapes.
* **2000s**: The rise of machine learning techniques to recognize and classify images.
* **2010s**: The deep learning revolution led to massive improvements in object detection and recognition through neural networks.

### Example:
* **Edge Detection**: Algorithms like **Sobel** and **Canny** allow detection of sharp changes in intensity, helping computers identify object boundaries.

## 3. Image Formation

**Image Formation** is the process by which images are captured or formed through the interaction of light with objects. Understanding how images are created is fundamental to many tasks in computer vision.

### Types of Image Formation:
* **Optical Image Formation**: Describes how light reflects off surfaces and is captured by the human eye or camera sensor.
* **Geometric Image Formation**: Deals with how 3D scenes are projected onto 2D image planes.

---

## 4. Photometric Image Formation

**Photometric Image Formation** involves understanding how light interacts with surfaces and objects, influencing the brightness and colors of the captured image. It helps explain the way lighting, shadows, and surface textures affect an image.

### Factors Affecting Photometric Image Formation:
* **Illumination**: The amount of light hitting an object.
* **Surface Reflectance**: How much light is reflected from a surface.
* **Shadows and Highlights**: Caused by uneven lighting conditions.

### Example:
* A bright object in a dark room will appear overexposed, while an object in shadow may lose details. Understanding this helps in adjusting image contrast and brightness.

## 5. The Digital Camera

A **digital camera** converts the analog light signals into digital data to produce images. It plays a crucial role in **Computer Vision**, as it captures the data (image) that will be analyzed.

### Components of a Digital Camera:
* **Lens**: Focuses light onto the camera sensor.
* **Sensor**: Captures light and converts it into electrical signals.
* **Processor**: Converts sensor data into digital images.

### Image Representation in Digital Cameras:
* **Pixels**: Digital images are made of pixels, tiny units that store color and intensity information.
* **Resolution**: The number of pixels in an image determines its resolution, influencing detail.

### Example:
* A **12-megapixel camera** captures 12 million pixels, providing high-resolution images for analysis.

## 6. Image Processing

**Image Processing** involves transforming or analyzing images to extract useful information. It plays a key role in preparing images for tasks like recognition and classification in **Computer Vision**.

### Key Image Processing Techniques:
1. **Point Operators**: Modify individual pixel values to enhance or correct images.
2. **Linear Filtering**: Applies filters to smooth, sharpen, or detect features in an image.

---

### 6.1 Point Operators

**Point Operators** work by changing the pixel values independently, usually to enhance image quality or remove noise. 

#### Types of Point Operations:
* **Brightness Adjustment**: Increasing or decreasing the intensity of pixels.
* **Contrast Enhancement**: Stretching the difference between pixel intensities.
* **Thresholding**: Converting grayscale images into binary images by setting a threshold.

### Example:
* A noisy image can have its brightness reduced using a point operator, making it clearer.

---

### 6.2 Linear Filtering

**Linear Filtering** is a technique used to modify an image by applying a convolution filter, which emphasizes specific patterns or features.

#### Common Types of Filters:
* **Smoothing Filters**: Reduce noise and blur details (e.g., **Gaussian Filter**).
* **Edge Detection Filters**: Highlight edges in images (e.g., **Sobel Filter**).

### Example:
* A **Gaussian Filter** can be applied to blur an image slightly, helping reduce sharp noise, while an **Edge Detection Filter** helps identify boundaries in images.
