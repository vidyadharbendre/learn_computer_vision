# CCD Technology: Charge-Coupled Devices

**CCD (Charge-Coupled Device)** technology is one of the earliest and most widely used image sensor technologies. It is renowned for producing **high-quality, low-noise images**, making it ideal for professional and scientific applications.

## How CCD Sensors Work

1. **Light enters** the sensor and strikes the photodiodes.  
2. Each photodiode generates **electrons** proportional to the lightâ€™s intensity.  
3. The generated charge is transferred pixel-by-pixel along the sensor until it reaches the **output amplifier**.  
4. The output is then converted to a **digital signal** for image processing.

## Applications of CCD Sensors

- **Professional Photography**: Produces high-resolution and low-noise images.  
- **Medical Imaging**: Commonly used in X-ray and microscopy.  
- **Astronomy**: Excellent for capturing distant, faint objects.

## CCD vs. CMOS

- **CCD Sensors**: Provide superior image quality and light sensitivity but consume more power.  
- **CMOS Sensors**: Faster and more energy-efficient, but generally exhibit more noise in low light conditions.
