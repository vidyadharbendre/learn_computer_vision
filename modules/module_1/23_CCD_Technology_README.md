# CCD Technology: Charge-Coupled Devices

**CCD (Charge-Coupled Device)** technology is one of the earliest and most widely used image sensor technologies. It is renowned for producing **high-quality, low-noise images**, making it ideal for professional and scientific applications.

## How CCD Sensors Work

1. **Light Enters the Sensor**: Light strikes the photodiodes.
2. **Charge Generation**: Each photodiode generates **electrons** proportional to the lightâ€™s intensity.
3. **Charge Transfer**: The generated charge is transferred pixel-by-pixel along the sensor using the **bucket brigade** method. This process involves shifting the charge through a series of capacitive nodes, allowing for the orderly movement of charge to the next stage.
4. **Output Amplification**: The charge reaches the **output amplifier**, where it is converted into a **digital signal** for image processing.

## Applications of CCD Sensors

- **Professional Photography**: Produces high-resolution and low-noise images.
- **Medical Imaging**: Commonly used in X-ray and microscopy.
- **Astronomy**: Excellent for capturing distant, faint objects.

## CCD vs. CMOS

- **CCD Sensors**: Provide superior image quality and light sensitivity but consume more power.
- **CMOS Sensors**: Faster and more energy-efficient but generally exhibit more noise in low-light conditions.
