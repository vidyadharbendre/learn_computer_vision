# Newer Image Sensors

Advancements in image sensor technology have led to significant improvements in digital photography and videography.

## Types of Newer Image Sensors

1. **Backside Illuminated (BSI) Sensors**: Improve low-light performance by placing wiring behind the photodetector.
2. **Stacked Sensors**: Combine photodetectors and processing circuitry into a single unit for faster readouts.
3. **Multi-Spectral Sensors**: Capture a broader range of light wavelengths for improved color accuracy.

## Benefits of Newer Sensors

1. **Enhanced Sensitivity**: Improved performance in low-light conditions.
2. **Higher Dynamic Range**: Better handling of highlights and shadows in the same image.
3. **Faster Processing**: Increased speed for burst shooting and video recording.
