# Bayesian Perspective on Computer Vision and Computer Graphics

Bayesian inference provides a powerful framework to understand the relationship between **Computer Vision** and **Computer Graphics**. In this context, we can view **Computer Vision** and **Computer Graphics** as two sides of the same coin, distinguished by how they approach the probabilistic modeling of images and models.

## 1. **Computer Vision: P(model | image)**

### a) **Definition**
In **Computer Vision**, the goal is to infer a model from an observed image. This can be expressed in Bayesian terms as the conditional probability:

P(model | image)

This represents the probability of a model given an observed image.

### b) **Explanation**
**Computer Vision** is fundamentally an inverse problem. We are given an image, and we want to infer the underlying model that produced it. The model could be a 3D object, a scene structure, or some semantic content like an object class (e.g., car, person).

**Bayesian Inference** allows us to combine prior knowledge about the model with the likelihood of the observed data (image) to make inferences about the most probable model.

### c) **Mathematical Representation**
Using Bayes' Theorem:

P(model | image) = [P(image | model) * P(model)] / P(image)

- **Likelihood**: `P(image | model)` describes how likely an image is, given a particular model.
- **Prior**: `P(model)` represents our prior knowledge or assumptions about the model.
- **Posterior**: `P(model | image)` is the desired probability distribution over models, given the observed image.

### d) **Example**
- **Object Recognition**: In object recognition, the task is to infer the identity (model) of an object in an image. The process evaluates different models (e.g., car, tree) based on the observed image.
- **Pose Estimation**: Inferring the 3D pose (model) of a human body from an observed 2D image.

### e) **Applications**
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Estimating the environment (road, obstacles) from camera images.
- **Medical Imaging**: Reconstructing 3D organ structures from 2D MRI or CT scan images.

## 2. **Computer Graphics: P(image | model)**

### a) **Definition**
In **Computer Graphics**, the goal is to generate an image given a model. This can be expressed probabilistically as:

P(image | model)


This represents the probability of generating an image given a specific model.

### b) **Explanation**
**Computer Graphics** is a forward problem. Given a known model (e.g., 3D object, scene), the task is to render or generate an image that represents that model.

The model contains information about the geometry, lighting, and texture, and the graphics pipeline uses this information to produce an image.

### c) **Mathematical Representation**
In a rendering pipeline, we assume we know the model:


P(image | model)


This likelihood is often modeled using the physics of light transport, materials, and camera characteristics. The challenge is to generate a realistic image from the known model.

### d) **Example**
- **Rendering**: Generating a photorealistic image of a car from its 3D model, using ray tracing or rasterization.
- **Animation**: Creating frame-by-frame images of a character model moving, based on animation data.

### e) **Applications**
- **Virtual Reality**: Creating immersive environments by generating lifelike images from 3D models.
- **Video Games**: Rendering realistic environments and characters based on predefined models and textures.

## 3. **Summary: Two Sides of Bayesian Inference**

In summary, **Computer Vision** and **Computer Graphics** are closely related:

- **Computer Vision** is concerned with the inverse problem: inferring models from images (`P(model | image)`).
- **Computer Graphics** is concerned with the forward problem: generating images from models (`P(image | model)`).
