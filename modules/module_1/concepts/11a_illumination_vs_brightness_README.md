# Comparison of Illumination and Irradiance, Brightness and Radiance

Understanding the distinctions between illumination and irradiance, as well as brightness and radiance, is essential for analyzing how light interacts with surfaces and how it is captured in images. Below is a detailed comparison of these concepts.

## 1. Illumination

Illumination refers to the **intensity of light** falling on a surface, which can influence the perception of objects within that space.

## 2. Irradiance

Irradiance quantifies the amount of **radiant energy** received per unit area on a surface. It is measured in units of **power per unit area** ('W/m²') and is described mathematically as:

'E = \frac{d\Phi}{dA}'

where 'dΦ' is the radiant flux and 'dA' is the area.

## 3. Radiance

Radiance measures the amount of **light energy** emitted from a specific area in a specific direction. It is defined as **power per unit area per unit solid angle** and is given by:

'L = \frac{d^2\Phi}{dA \cdot d\Omega \cdot \cos(\theta)}'

where 'dΦ' is the radiant flux, 'dA' is the area, 'dΩ' is the solid angle, and 'θ' is the angle from the surface normal.

## 4. Brightness

Brightness refers to the **perceived brightness** of an object, which is subjective to human vision. It is influenced by various factors, including contrast and the observer's surroundings, making it distinct from the physical quantities of irradiance and radiance.
