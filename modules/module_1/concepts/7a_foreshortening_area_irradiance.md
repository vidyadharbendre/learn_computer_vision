# Foreshortening Angle in Radiance and Irradiance

The **foreshortening angle** refers to the effect of viewing a surface at an angle, which causes it to appear shorter than its actual dimensions. This concept is significant in radiometry, particularly concerning how light interacts with surfaces at various angles.

## 1. Foreshortening in Radiance

- **Definition**: In the context of radiance, the foreshortening angle influences the amount of light that reaches a surface based on the angle of incidence. When light strikes a surface at an angle, the effective area illuminated by the light is reduced.

- **Mathematical Representation**: If 'L' is the radiance arriving at a surface, the **effective area** 'A' that the light strikes can be represented as:

  'A' = 'A * cos(θ)'

  where:
  - 'A' is the actual area of the surface,
  - 'θ' is the angle between the surface normal and the incoming light direction.

## 2. Foreshortening in Irradiance

- **Definition**: For irradiance, the foreshortening angle also affects how much light is received by a surface. The **irradiance** 'E' on a surface is related to the incoming light flux, and this value decreases when light strikes at an angle.

- **Mathematical Representation**: The irradiance at a point on a surface due to an incoming light source can be expressed as:

  'E' = 'Φ / A * cos(θ)'

  where:
  - 'E' is the irradiance (power per unit area),
  - 'Φ' is the total luminous flux incident on the surface,
  - 'A' is the area of the surface,
  - 'θ' is the angle of incidence.
