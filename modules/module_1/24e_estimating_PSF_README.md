# Estimating PSF and Aliasing in Image Processing

## Laboratory Estimation of PSF

Under laboratory conditions, the PSF can be estimated by observing a point light source (e.g., a pinhole in black cardboard illuminated from behind). However, this estimation is accurate only to pixel resolution.

### Alternative Techniques

To model sub-pixel shapes of the PSF and predict aliasing more accurately, calibration patterns consisting of slanted step edges can be employed. 

## Aliasing in Image Processing

Aliasing is not only introduced during image acquisition but can also arise in various image processing operations, such as resampling, upsampling, and downsampling. Careful selection of filters can help reduce the amount of aliasing in these operations.
