# Chip Size

The size of the image sensor chip plays a vital role in determining the performance and capabilities of a digital camera.

## What is Chip Size?

- **Definition**: The physical dimensions of the image sensor chip, typically measured in inches or millimeters.
- **Common Sizes**: Full-frame, APS-C, Micro Four Thirds, 1-inch sensors.

## Effects of Chip Size

1. **Field of View**: Larger sensors provide a wider field of view.
2. **Depth of Field**: Larger sensors typically achieve shallower depth of field effects.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how chip size influences image quality and performance.
- Recognize the implications of chip size in different camera systems.

## Next Steps

- Learn about **Sensor Gain** and its impact on image brightness and quality.
