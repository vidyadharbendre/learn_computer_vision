# Shutter Speed

Shutter speed is a crucial setting in digital photography that controls the duration of light exposure to the image sensor.

## What is Shutter Speed?

- **Definition**: The length of time the camera's shutter is open to allow light to hit the sensor.
- **Measured in**: Seconds or fractions of a second (e.g., 1/500, 1", 2").

## Effects of Shutter Speed

1. **Motion Blur**: Longer shutter speeds can create a blur effect for moving subjects.
2. **Exposure**: Faster shutter speeds allow less light, while slower speeds allow more light.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to adjust shutter speed for different lighting conditions.
- Learn the impact of shutter speed on motion and exposure.

## Next Steps

- Study **Sampling Pitch** and its importance in image quality.
