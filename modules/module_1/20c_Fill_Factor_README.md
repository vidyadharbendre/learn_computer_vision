# Fill Factor

The fill factor is a critical parameter that indicates the efficiency of an image sensor in converting light into electrical signals.

## What is Fill Factor?

- **Definition**: The ratio of the area of the photodetector to the total area of the pixel, including non-sensitive areas.
- **Calculation**: Fill Factor = (Photodetector Area / Total Pixel Area) x 100%

## Importance of Fill Factor

1. **Light Sensitivity**: Higher fill factors generally lead to better light sensitivity and image quality.
2. **Design Considerations**: Sensor designs aim to maximize fill factor without compromising pixel size.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the significance of fill factor in image sensors.
- Learn how fill factor affects overall image quality.

## Next Steps

- Investigate **Chip Size** and its implications for camera performance.
